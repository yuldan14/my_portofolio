          <p>
            <span>Zetro</span> is my first group-project at a College which was
            written by three members and one lecturer. This project is in the
            form of a website that can predict the value of gold based on data.
            The method of predict that we use is time-series forecasting. Based
            on the definition of Time-series Forecasting that i found on
            Tableau, Time series forecasting is the process of analyzing time
            series data using statistics and modeling to make predictions and
            inform strategic decision-making. It's not always an exact
            prediction, and likelihood of forecasts can vary wildly—especially
            when dealing with the commonly fluctuating variables in time series
            data as well as factors outside our control. However, forecasting
            insight about which outcomes are more likely—or less likely—to occur
            than other potential outcomes. Often, the more comprehensive the
            data we have, the more accurate the forecasts can be. While
            forecasting and “prediction” generally mean the same thing, there is
            a notable distinction. In some industries, forecasting might refer
            to data at a specific future point in time, while prediction refers
            to future data in general. Series forecasting is often used in
            conjunction with time series analysis. Time series analysis involves
            developing models to gain an understanding of the data to understand
            the underlying causes. Analysis can provide the “why” behind the
            outcomes you are seeing. Forecasting then takes the next step of
            what to do with that knowledge and the predictable extrapolations of
            what might happen in the future.

            This journal is written based on monetary crisis which went viral on
            2022. Furthermore, Corona pandemics was still existed on 2022. It
            has a huge impact on economic viability and stability.
            <span>Zetro </span>is a software that can help predict the value of
            gold which is never increased-decreased significantly. It may
            helpful for investor to invest their money into gold and know when
            they can sell the gold so that they get profit.

            This journal was written based on the issue of Indonesian capital relocation. The relocation of the Capital of Indonesia has a huge impact in various aspects. One of them is economic's aspect. There are lots of things to prepare. Food security is one of several things to watch out for. This resarch is useful to predict the productivity of agricultural and livestock product from 2021 until 2025. Based on data, we can predict the productivity using ARIMA algorythm. On the other hand, we also do clustering of the commodities into some categories from priority until not priority.
